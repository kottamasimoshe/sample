1.what is list and tuple?
list: List is a mutable sequence of elements(int,float,strings,characters) separated by commas enclosed in square brackets.
eg:[1,"a","str",9.0]
tuple: Tuple is a immutable sequence of elements(int,float,strings,characters) separated by commas enclosed in Braces.
eg:(1,"a","str",9.0)

2.when to use list and when to use tuple.

lists are dynamic in nature whereas tuples are fixed in nature.


Tuples are fixed size in nature whereas lists are dynamic.
In other words, a tuple is immutable whereas a list is mutable.
print m

    You can't add elements to a tuple. Tuples have no append or extend method.
    You can't remove elements from a tuple. Tuples have no remove or pop method.
    You can find elements in a tuple, since this doesn’t change the tuple.
    You can also use the in operator to check if an element exists in the tuple.
Tuples are faster than lists. If you're defining a constant set of values and all you're ever going to do with it is iterate through it, use a tuple instead of a list.

It makes your code safer if you “write-protect” data that does not need to be changed. Using a tuple instead of a list is like having an implied assert statement that this data is constant, and that special thought (and a specific function) is required to override that.

  
3.what is isstance?,where can you use isinstance?

Instance is referenced to a method and isinstance is used to identify a particular datatype
eg: a=5
isinstance(a,int)
>>True

depends on the result it will be returing True or false

4.basic data types in python
List
tuple
dictionary
set
numbers

5.what are different data structures in python?
list
tuple
dictionary
sets
strings

6.how can u add a list(list of elements) to an existing list?
we can add a list to an existing list by using append
a=[1,2,3,4]
b=[1,2,3,4]
b.extend(a)

7.what is set?
a set is a unique mutable unordered sequence of elements (int,float,strings,characters) separated by commas and enclosed in flower braces
a={1,"a","b",4,"pp"}

8.what is frozonset?
a frozenset is to make a set as immutable.
a={1,"a","b",4,"pp"}
frozenset.add(6)# throws an error

9.what different keywords in python,can we use keywords as variables?

and       del       from      not       while
as        elif      global    or        with
assert    else      if        pass      yield
break     except    import    print
class     exec      in        raise
continue  finally   is        return 
def       for       lambda    try

we cannot use keywords as variables as keywords are reserved words.

10.print the elements of the list by skipping 2 elements ?
	ex l=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] output = [1,4,7]

l=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
m=l[0:9:3]
print m
o/p : [1,4,7]

11.Reverse a list with out using built in functions?
l=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
c=l[::-1]
print l

12.what are dict? write dict functions?
dict is a inbuilt function for dictionary which is a key-value pair 

cmp(dict1,dict2)
len(dict)
str(dict)
type(variable)
dict.items()
dict.keys()
dict.values()
dict.update(dict1)

13.find second largest number in the given list without using built in functions?
14.Transform list to other data structure?
list1=[1,2,3,4]
b=tuple(list1)
print b
o/p: (1,2,3,4)

15.how to create flat list from list of lists? ex l=[[1,2],[6,3],[4,5]] o/p = [1,2,6,3,4,5]
l=[[1,2],[6,3],[4,5]]
b=reduce(lambda x,y: x+y,l)
print b

16.Split the list into evenly sized chunks? 
 ex : if l=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] o/p = [(1,2,3),(4,5,6),(7,8,9)]
17.what is list comprehension and how does it works?
list comphrehension is a way of creating a list in a consise way
																																													


18.How can you copy a dict into other dict?

dict1={1:2,5:6}																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										
dict2=dict1.copy()

19.what is the output of the following code ?
	s1="python"
	s2=s1
	s2.replace("p","j")
	print s1,s2
s1="python"
s2="jython"
20.what is the output of the following code ?
	l=[1,2,3,4]
	l1=l
	l2=l[:]
	l1.append(5)
	print l
	print l1
	print																																																																																																																																																																						l2
[1,2,3,4,5]																																																																																																																																																																																																									
[1,2,3,4,5]
[1,2,3,4,5]
